# ife-ex

(Unfathomly stupid) exercises in C.
My coding style heavily deviates from the one we were suggested.
This is due to theirs being heavily outdated, poorly sourced and sometimes plain stupid.

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/adri326/ife-exercises
cd ife-ex
```

Then build the project:

```sh
